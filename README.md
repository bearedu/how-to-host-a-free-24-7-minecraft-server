<h3>download the jar file at https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server</h3>
<p>after you have the jar file downloaded, create your server folder and place the jar file in, create a new text file inside of the file and then double click/run the jar file, it will then create a eula text file which you then have to turn eula=false to eula=true, then you can finish it off by port forwarding your server oout if you want your friends to join too!</p>
